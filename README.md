# Practical investigation of Uplift packages

## Plan

* Investigate the Hillstrom e-mail dataset (similar to Emaar's data)
* Try each uplift model in the `uplift` R package
* Try each quality metric (geni, qini, uplift curve)
* Investigate other packages/softwares (matlab, python, SAS)

## Useful links
